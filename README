GettextWysiwyg
==============

Rails plugin that turns your GetText-enabled website into a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor for text.  See some text that needs to change?  Click on it and edit it right in your browser.  Set this up to run on a server and give your product/marketing team access to it so you don't have to make copy changes again!

Requirements:
	* GetText gem 
	(sudo gem install gettext)
	* gettext_localize plugin 
	(script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gettextlocalize/trunk/gettext_localize)

Configuration:
	1. Generate controller & views:
	./script/generate gettext_wysiwyg MessageTranslations
	2. Enable gettext_wysiwig, add this to environment.rb:
	$gettext_wysiwyg = true
	3. Ensure these conventions are followed:
		* Po file directory is #{RAILS_ROOT}/po/#{locale}
		* URLs prefixed with lang param ':lang/:controller/:action/:id'
	4. It is helpful to add this to your stylesheet:
        .gettext:hover { border:solid 1px red; padding:-1px -1px;}

Tricky stuff:
    + Link Text - since all gettext becomes clickable - the links either work or the text is not editable
    + Title bar - I recommend calling the GetText.gettext() method instead of _()
    + Error messages - The model names don't seem to call the underscore method.
You'll need to use the index action or a traditional po editor to edit these "tricky" messages
