Description:
    This will add a MessageTranslations controller as well as two views 
    for interacting with your translations on your website.

	Since this will probably end up making your site look terrible you need
	run in development environment AND explicitly TURN IT ON by adding the 
	following near the top of your environment.rb
		$gettext_wysiwyg = true
	
    It is helpful to add this to your stylesheet:
        .gettext:hover { border:solid 1px red; padding:-1px -1px;}
	
	Tricky stuff:
        + Link Text - since all gettext becomes clickable - the links either work or the text is not editable
        + Title bar - I recommend calling the GetText.gettext() method instead of _()
        + Error messages - The model names don't seem to call the underscore method.
	You'll need to use the index action or a traditional po editor to edit these "tricky" messages

Example:
    ./script/generate gettext_wysiwyg MessageTranslations

    This will create:
        app/controllers/message_translations_controller.rb
        app/views/message_translations/edit.html.erb 
        app/views/message_translations/index.html.erb
